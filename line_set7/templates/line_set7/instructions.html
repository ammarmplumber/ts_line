        Instructions - Set 7
    </h3>

    <p>
        This is Set #7 of ten sets of five rounds--a total of 50 rounds.
    </p>

    <p>
        In this study, you will be in a randomly formed group
        of {{ Constants.players_per_group }} participants. Each participant in
        the group may choose one of three colors: red, blue, or yellow. Your
        payoff at the end of each round depends on the color you choose and the
        colors chosen by the other participants.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the following set of five rounds, the maximum payoff you can earn per round is $28.
        The payoffs may change between sets.
    </p>

    <p>
        The diagram displayed below portrays the information flow between
        the {{ Constants.players_per_group }} participants. Each participant
        will only see the colors chosen by participants they are connected to
        by a black line. At the end of each round, you (the blue dot) will
        see the colors chosen by the participants represented by green dots.
        You will know your only own payoff, not the payoffs of any others.
